== Introduction

Documentation for the Vocabulary server API.

== Authentication

Authentication is required for all POST, PUT and DELETE requests.
There are 2 ways to authenticate: basic auth and JWT.

=== Basic Auth

[source,bash]
----
$ curl --user user:password {{host}}
----

=== JWT

JWT tokens are issued by the endpoint http://api.gbif-dev.org/v1/user/login.
This call should be done using basic auth.

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -X POST {{host}} -H 'Bearer: f5036eda-0da6-4099-9131-863a511e1cd1'
----

== Client Errors

There are basically 2 possible types of client errors:

* 400 Bad Request: returned when the JSON is invalid or the request is not well-formed
* 422 Unprocessable Entity: returned when the request is syntactically correct but the fields are invalid (required fields not set, duplicated keys, inconsistent keys, etc.)
* 403 Forbidden: returned when the request is trying to perfom an unsupported operation
